# ECGFlowCMR: Unlocking the Potential of ECG for Cine CMR Representation Learning via Generative Data Augmentation

### Abstract: 
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) enables comprehensive evaluation of cardiac morphology and function but is constrained by high acquisition costs and the need for expert annotation, which limit large-scale data availability. In contrast, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are cost-effective, broadly accessible, and can serve as conditioning inputs for the generative synthesis of cine CMR. We propose ECGFlowCMR, a novel ECG-to-CMR generative framework that integrates a Phase-Aware Masked Autoencoder (PA-MAE) and an Anatomy-Motion Disentangled Flow (AMDF) to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the cross-modal temporal mismatch between multi-beat ECG recordings and single-cycle CMR sequences, and (2) the anatomical observability gap resulting from the limited structural information in ECG signals. Extensive experiments on the UK Biobank and a proprietary clinical dataset demonstrate that ECGFlowCMR generates realistic cine CMR sequences from ECG inputs, thereby enabling scalable pretraining and enhancing performance on downstream cardiac analysis tasks.
